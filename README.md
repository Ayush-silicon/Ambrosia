# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

### ğŸ¤– Introduction
Build and deploy a stunning GSAP-powered cocktail website using React and Tailwind CSSâ€”a modern, scroll-driven experience packed with advanced animations. Bring your design to life with dynamic SplitText reveals, smooth parallax scrolling, and scroll-triggered effects using GSAPâ€™s ScrollTrigger. Lock sections in place with pinned animations, sync video playback to scroll position for cinematic storytelling, and enhance visual impact with scroll-based image masking.
